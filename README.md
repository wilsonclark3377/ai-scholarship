🌟 Why I'm a Strong Candidate for an AI Scholarship

🧠 Overview

I am a **generalist with a mission-driven focus on AI ethics and safety**, particularly in domains where AI can have the most profound impact: **mental health, crisis response, and vulnerable populations**. My ability to rapidly shift interests and connect ideas across disciplines allows me to identify systemic risks in AI systems and design solutions that prioritize human dignity, safety, and transparency.  


This repository serves as a **portfolio and pitch** for AI scholarship programs like the [AI Grant Accelerator](https://aigrant.com), showcasing my skills, values, and vision for becoming the **World’s First Independent LLM Mental Health Safety Auditor**.  


⸻


🔍 Unique Perspective: Generalist as a Strength
• **Systems Thinking**: My polymathic approach lets me audit AI across domains (e.g., mental health, legal, education) and spot risks specialists might miss.  
• **Adaptive Focus**: Rapidly shifting interests mean I can tackle new challenges in AI safety without being constrained by a single field.  
• **Ethical Lens**: I view AI as a "conspiracy-level" disruptive force that demands **democratized oversight** to prevent elite control and harm.


⸻


⚙️ Technical Expertise

I have hands-on experience with:  
• **LLM Stress-Testing**: Adversarial prompt engineering for crisis, crime, and substance abuse scenarios.  
• **Moderation APIs**:  
- [OpenAI Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation) for detecting harmful content.  
- [Google Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com) for analyzing emotional tone and toxicity.  
• **Ethical AI Tools**:  
- [CircleGuardBench](https://circleguardbench.com) for benchmarking ethical boundaries.  
- Custom prompt frameworks to evaluate LLMs in sensitive contexts.


⸻


🛡️ Ethical Stewardship
• **Preventing Harm**: I’ve designed protocols to ensure AI systems do not accidentally enable self-harm, crime, or trauma reenactment.  
• **Privacy-First Design**: Advocate for **text-based, WiFi-only** AI solutions (e.g., avoiding phone-based systems like 988 hotlines).  
• **Transparency Advocacy**: Push for **independent auditing** of AI systems to build public trust and prevent "lawsuitopias" (legal disasters from unsafe AI).


⸻


🌍 Vision for the Future

I aim to create a world where AI is a **force for good**, especially for those who need it most but cannot access traditional systems. My work will:  
• Audit LLMs in mental health, victim support, and crisis response.  
• Build **open-source tools** for ethical AI benchmarking and safety testing.  
• Publish **public safety reports** to hold AI developers accountable.  
• Democratize AI safety knowledge to counteract elite control.


⸻


🚀 Roadmap for the AI Grant Accelerator
1. **Build a Demo Platform**: A simple website showcasing sample LLM audits and safety protocols.  
2. **Publish Early Work**: Stress-test existing mental health chatbots (e.g., Wysa, Woebot) and share findings.  
3. **Apply to AI Grant Batch 5**: Expected in early 2026. Use funding to scale independent auditing and open-source tools.  
4. **Collaborate with Ethical AI Startups**: Partner with mission-aligned teams to improve safety standards.


⸻


📌 Why I’m a Strong Candidate
• **Mission-Driven**: I’m not just building tools—I’m building **trust** in AI for critical human needs.  
• **Technical Depth**: Proven ability to test and improve LLMs in high-stakes scenarios.  
• **Ethical Rigor**: My work addresses the existential risks of AI while prioritizing marginalized users.  
• **Scalable Impact**: The role of an independent auditor is a **novel niche** with global relevance.

⸻


📅 Timeline for AI Grant Accelerator (Batch 5)
• **Expected Launch**: Q1 2026 (likely January or February).  
• **Preparation Steps**:  
1. Finalize my portfolio and pitch deck.  
2. Begin sharing AI safety insights on social media.  
3. Stress-test 3–5 LLMs in mental health and crisis response.


⸻


📎 Call to Action
